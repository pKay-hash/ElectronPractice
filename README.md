# ElectronPractice
Designed to be a place to store all of the electron projects that I plan to create in one repo

1. electron-hello-world
The very first project I've done using electron, which is a simple calculator. Very poorly named.

2. screen-recorder
The second project I've done. Had to put a break in it to understand more about preload.js and bridging to allow Electron functions into the renderer.js file.
Also put a break in it because of the way that I've originally set this up, causing issues with git. Most likely had to do with using forge to create the Electron app.

3. image-resizer-electron
An app that allows people to resize images to any dimension.
